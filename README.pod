LWPx::Profile - Basic Timing of HTTP Requests

=head1 VERSION

version 0.1

=head1 SYNOPSIS

	use LWP::UserAgent;
	use LWPx::Profile;
	
	my $ua = LWP::UserAgent;
	
	LWPx::Profile::start_profile();
	foreach my $url (@sites) {
		$ua->get($url);
	}
	my $results = LWPx::Profile::stop_profile;


=head1 DESCRIPTION

This module provides a basic profiling framework for looking at how long
HTTP requests with LWP took to complete.  The data structure returned by
C<stop_profile> is a hashref of request-string => stats pairs.  For example:


	'GET http://www.google.com/
	User-Agent: libwww-perl/6.08

	' => {
		'shortest_duration' => '0.111438989639282',
		'time_of_first_sample' => '1424211134.8376',
		'longest_duration' => '0.202037811279297',
		'count' => 3,
		'total_duration' => '0.436195850372314',
		'time_of_last_sample' => '1424211135.07221',
		'first_duration' => '0.202037811279297'
	};


In this example, there have been three requests for http://www.google.com/.
